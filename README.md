# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19
dataset to understand trends in confirmed cases and deaths across different
countries and continents.

The analysis focuses on time-based trends, regional impact, and basic
socio-economic relationships using Python.

##  Objectives
- Analyze monthly trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Compare COVID-19 impact across continents
- Identify the most affected countries

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available COVID-19 dataset
sourced from **Kaggle**.

Key features used:
- Continent
- Location (Country)
- Date
- Total Cases
- Total Deaths
- GDP per Capita
- Human Development Index (HDI)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Monthly trend analysis
- Continent-wise comparison
- Country-level analysis
- Visualization of insights

## 📊 Key Insights
- COVID-19 cases and deaths showed clear peaks during specific months,
  indicating multiple waves of infection.
- Europe and North America reported higher cumulative cases compared
  to other continents.
- Countries with higher GDP per capita also reported higher case counts,
  possibly due to higher testing and reporting rates.

## 🧾 Conclusion
This exploratory analysis highlights global COVID-19 trends across time
and regions. The project demonstrates how data analysis techniques can be
used to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
